# Landing Page (HTML/CSS Exercise)
* Date last modified: 3 Aug 2023

## Project Description
Static website landing page project created as a practical exercise for the usage of *HTML* and *CSS* (flexbox). This website is hosting using Github Pages at this [link](https://sebastingoh.github.io/landing/).

## Notes
This website is not mobile-friendly and should be viewed on screens sizes above *1020px* in width for elements to be presentable.

## Credits
Created with guidence from the Odin Project ([Project: Landing Page](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-landing-page)) I tried to stick to the design of the reference image for the landing page as much as possible.
